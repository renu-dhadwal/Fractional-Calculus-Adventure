# Fractional Calculus Adventure ðŸŽ®ðŸ“˜

Welcome to *Fractional Calculus Adventure*, an interactive course material designed as a **dialogue + game**.

## âœ¨ Features
- Dialogue-based explanations (mentor + learner).
- Game-style progression with "levels", "keys", and "quests".
- Theorems turned into proof challenges.
- Exercises in both text and Jupyter notebook form.
- Figures and graphs illustrating concepts like memory kernels.

## ðŸ“š Levels
1. Gate of Memory â€“ Fractional integrals, intuition of memory.
2. River of Derivatives â€“ Riemannâ€“Liouville vs. Caputo derivatives.
3. Chamber of Keys â€“ Properties of integrals (semigroup, linearity).
4. Tower of Transforms â€“ Laplace transforms and solving FDEs.
5. Arena of Proofs â€“ Existence and uniqueness theorems.
6. Bridge of Applications â€“ Viscoelasticity, anomalous diffusion, etc.
7. Mountain of Challenges â€“ Numerical methods.
8. Summit of Synthesis â€“ Modeling real systems.

## ðŸ›  How to Use
- Read the dialogues in `/chapters`.
- Work on exercises in `/exercises`.
- Attempt proof quests in `/proof-quests`.
- Explore figures in `/figures`.

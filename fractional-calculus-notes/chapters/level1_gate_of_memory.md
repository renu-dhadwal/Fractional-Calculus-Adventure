# üéÆ Level 1 ‚Äì The Temple of Smriti (Memory)

**Characters**:  
- **Acharya Anvaya (Guide/Teacher, continuity of knowledge)**  
- **Ananya (Learner, seeker of truth)**  

---

**Scene**: Ananya and Acharya Anvaya stand before the **Temple of Smriti (Memory)**. Its walls glow faintly with carved Sanskrit verses. Above the arch is inscribed:  

*‚Äú‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡§É ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç ‚Äî KƒÅla·∏• Sm·πõtir Nitya·πÅ (Time is eternal memory).‚Äù*

## Part I ‚Äì First Steps: Repeated Integration

**Acharya Anvaya**: Ananya, before the temple reveals its secret, let us recall what happens when we integrate repeatedly.  

**Question**: What is the integral of \(1\)?  

**Ananya**:  
\[
I^1 (1)(t) = \int_0^t 1\, d\tau = t.
\]  

**Acharya Anvaya**: Good. And integrating once more?  

**Ananya**:  
\[
I^2 (1)(t) = \int_0^t I^1(1)(\tau)\, d\tau = \int_0^t \tau\, d\tau = \frac{t^2}{2!}.
\]  

**Acharya Anvaya**: Excellent. And thrice?  

**Ananya**:  
\[
I^3 (1)(t) = \int_0^t \frac{\tau^2}{2!}\, d\tau = \frac{t^3}{3!}.
\]  

**Acharya Anvaya**: Do you see the pattern?  

**Ananya**: Yes ‚Äî after \(n\) integrations, we get  
\[
I^n (1)(t) = \frac{t^n}{n!}.
\]  

---

## Part II ‚Äì The Cauchy Formula

**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly. This formula can be written more generally using what is called the **Cauchy formula for repeated integration**:  

\[
I^n f(t) = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-1} f(\tau)\, d\tau.
\]  

For \(f(\tau)=1\), this becomes  
\[
I^n (1)(t) = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-1} d\tau = \frac{t^n}{n!}.
\]  

**Ananya**: Ah! So that‚Äôs where the kernel \((t-\tau)^{n-1}\) comes from ‚Äî it‚Äôs a compact way of writing repeated integrations.  

---

## Part III ‚Äì The Bridge of Gamma

**Acharya Anvaya**: Precisely. Now comes the real question: what if we want **half an integration**? Or any fractional number of integrations?  

**Ananya**: Then the factorial in the denominator must be extended to fractions.  

**Acharya Anvaya**: Just so. That extension is the **Gamma function**, which satisfies  
\[
\Gamma(n) = (n-1)! \quad \text{for integers } n.
\]  

By replacing factorials with Gamma, we extend the Cauchy formula to arbitrary order \(\alpha > 0\):  

\[
(I^\alpha f)(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\alpha-1} f(\tau)\, d\tau.
\]

## Part IV ‚Äì Memory Revealed

**Ananya**: So the fractional integral is just the natural continuation of repeated integrals, with \(\Gamma\) bridging the gap between integers and fractions!  

**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly. And notice how the kernel \((t-\tau)^{\alpha-1}\) gives weight to the past. Recent events dominate, but distant ones still whisper.  

**Ananya**: Whisper?  

**Acharya Anvaya**: Imagine blowing a *≈õa·πÖkha (conch shell)* in the Himalayas. The first sound is loud, but as time passes, only a faint echo lingers in the valleys. The fractional integral is just like that echo ‚Äî the past is never lost, only softened.  

**Ananya**: So the function carries echoes of its whole history.  

**Acharya Anvaya**: Well said. In fact, mathematicians call this the **memory effect**.

## üß© Mini-Quest 1: The Half-Memory

Evaluate \( (I^{1/2} 1)(t) \).  

- **Choice A**: Proportional to \(t^{1/2}\).  
- **Choice B**: Proportional to \(t\).  
- **Choice C**: Constant.  

**Ananya (after reflection)**:  
\[
(I^{1/2} 1)(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(1/2)} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{-1/2} d\tau = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\, t^{1/2}.
\]  

So the answer is **A**.  

---

**Acharya Anvaya**: Well done, Ananya. You have unlocked the **Key of Smriti (Memory)**. The temple doors now open to your next journey.  

---

## üß© Mini-Quest 2: Comparing Memories

Which value of \(\alpha\) remembers the distant past most strongly?  

- **Choice A**: \(\alpha = 0.2\)  
- **Choice B**: \(\alpha = 0.5\)  
- **Choice C**: \(\alpha = 0.9\)  

**Answer**: **A**, because the kernel decays more slowly.

üèÜ **Reward**: You have earned the **Key of Smriti (Memory)**.

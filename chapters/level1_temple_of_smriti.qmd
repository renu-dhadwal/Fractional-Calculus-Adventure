**Scene**: Ananya and Acharya Anvaya stand before the **Temple of Smriti (Memory)**. Its walls glow faintly with carved Sanskrit verses. Above the arch is inscribed:  

*"कालः स्मृतिर्नित्यं — Kālaḥ Smṛtir Nityaṁ (Time is eternal memory)."*

### Part I – First Steps: Repeated Integration and the Cauchy Forumula

**Acharya Anvaya**: Ananya, before the temple reveals its secret, let us recall what happens when we integrate repeatedly.

**Question**: What is the integral of $1$?

**Ananya**:

$$
I^1 (1)(t) = \int_0^t 1\, d\tau = t.
$$

**Acharya Anvaya**: Good. And integrating once more?

**Ananya**:

$$
I^2 (1)(t) = \int_0^t I^1(1)(\tau)\, d\tau = \int_0^t \tau\, d\tau = \frac{t^2}{2!}.
$$

**Acharya Anvaya**: Excellent. And thrice?

**Ananya**:

$$
I^3 (1)(t) = \int_0^t \frac{\tau^2}{2!}\, d\tau = \frac{t^3}{3!}.
$$

**Ananya**: Yes — after $n$ integrations, we get
$$I^n (1)(t) = \frac{t^n}{n!}.$$


**Acharya Anvaya**: Exactly. This formula can be written more generally using what is called the *Cauchy formula for repeated integration*:

$$
I^n f(t) = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-1} f(\tau)\, d\tau.
$$

For $f(\tau)=1$ this becomes

$$
I^n (1)(t) = \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\,n-1} d\tau = \frac{t^n}{n!}.
$$

## Part III – The Bridge of Gamma

**Acharya Anvaya**: Precisely. Now comes the real question: what if we want *half an integration*? Or any fractional number of integrations?

The *Gamma* function extends factorials: $\Gamma(n)=(n-1)!$, and replacing factorials with Gamma gives the fractional integral

$$
(I^\alpha f)(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{\alpha-1} f(\tau)\, d\tau.
$$

## Part IV – Memory Revealed

**Acharya Anvaya**: Notice how the kernel $(t-\tau)^{\alpha-1}$ gives weight to the past. Recent events dominate, but distant ones still whisper — like the fading resonance of a *śaṅkha (conch shell)*.

**Ananya**: So the function carries echoes of its whole history.

**Acharya Anvaya**: Well said. This is the *memory effect*.

### Mini-Quest 1: The Half-Memory

Evaluate $(I^{1/2} 1)(t)$.

- Choice A: proportional to $t^{1/2}$.
- Choice B: proportional to $t$.
- Choice C: constant.

Solution:

$$
(I^{1/2} 1)(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(1/2)}\int_0^t (t-\tau)^{-1/2}\, d\tau = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} t^{1/2}.
$$

You have earned the **Key of Smriti (Memory)**.
